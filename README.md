# PEER_workshop
 
Welcome to the repository for the Virtual Workshop on Spatial Genomic Data in R. The goal of this workhop is to provide an introduction to many commonly used tools for genomic data analysis and visualization. This workshop is targeted to participants who are fairly new to programming and command line data analysis. While becoming an expert in these skills will likely take more than the time we plan to spend here, we hope that during the workshop you will gain experience with some of the tools and an awareness of resources you can use to continue your learning in this arena after the workshop.

This workshop is made possible thanks to support from a [USAID PEER Cycle 8 Grant](https://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/PEER/PEERscience/PGA_195540) to Dr. Steven Runo and a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology to Dr. Emily Bellis under [Grant No. 1711950](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1711950&HistoricalAwards=false).
