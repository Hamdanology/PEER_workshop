# Introduction
 
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Virtual Workshop on Spatial Genomic Data in R. The goal of this workhop is to provide an introduction to many commonly used tools for genomic data analysis and visualization. This workshop is targeted to participants who are fairly new to programming and command line data analysis. While becoming an expert in these skills will take more time and practice than this 1 week workshop, we hope that you will gain confidence with some of the tools and an awareness of additional resources to continue your learning afterward.  Most of the activities have been adapted based on free and open source learning materials available through [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/) which provides a wealth of online resources for future learning.  We also have adapted some of the materials to use genomic data from *Striga hermonthica* collected as part of our ongoing USAID and NSF funded project.

This workshop is made possible thanks to support from [USAID PEER Grant No. 8-66](https://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/PEER/PEERscience/PGA_195540) to Dr. Steven Runo and National Science Foundation Grant No. 1711950 to Dr. Emily Bellis.
