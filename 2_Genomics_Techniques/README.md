# Session 2: Genomics Techniques
This session will provide an overview for understanding a common file format for sequence reads (FASTQ) on the command line, interpreting read quality, mapping to a reference, and calling genomic variants. It is derived from the [Data Wrangling and Processing for Genomics Lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/wrangling-genomics/) from [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/) which provides a more in-depth view of these topics.  To facilitate analysis on your local machine, we provide a smaller dataset (instead of the <i>E. coli</i> used for the Data Carpentry lession), and provide some additional information to help get things to run on your local machine.
