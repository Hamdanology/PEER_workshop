# Session 3: R Graphics 
This session will provide an introduction to visualizing data with `ggplot2`.  We will follow pretty closely the [Data Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists Lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/index.html) from [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/) which provides a much better and in-depth view of these topics. There are many other parts of this lesson you can check out if you want to. Today we will just focus on the 5th episode: [Data Visualization with ggplot2](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/04-visualization-ggplot2.html). 

## Prior to the session: 
1. **Download and install R**.  Follow the instructions [here](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/#Install_R_and_RStudio)
